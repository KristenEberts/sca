# Conversion

## TL;DR

Convert user inputted hours and minutes into just minutes. Then, covert them into just hours.

## Background

We're going to play around with converting different units into one common unit!

## Your Mission

### Problem 0

In a file called `conversion0.py`, take in input from the user for hours and minutes. Then, we'll use an integer to represent to total number of minutes the user has entered after converting hours into minutes! Lastly, we'll print this value to the screen!

### Problem 1

In a file called `conversion1.py`, take in input from the user for hours and minutes. Then, we want to create a float for time in hours (where the digits to the left of the decimal represent whole hours and to the right, fractions of an hour). In other words, were converting all hours and minutes into total hours. Lastly, we'll print this value to the screen!
