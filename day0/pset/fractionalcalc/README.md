# Fractional Calculator

## TL;DR

Create a calculator that can take in fractions as input like below:

```
$ python calc.py
First number: 5/3
Operation: x
Second number: 10/7
50/21
```

## Bonus Challenges

Try implementing as much functionality as you're able to! First try allowing your
calculator to handle both fractions and non-fractions, such as:

```
$ python calc.py
First number: 5/3
Operation: x
Second number: 10
50/3
```
Next, try to take in everything as a single input:

```
$ python calc.py
Expression: 1/3 ^ 3
1/9
```
Finally, implement functionality for a calculator that can take in expressions
of indefinite length:

```
$ python calc.py
Expression: 1/3 ^ 3 * 13/2 + 7/4
89/36
```
