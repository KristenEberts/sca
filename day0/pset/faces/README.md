# Faces

## TL;DR

Print some faces and shapes!

## Background

Let's quickly play around with `print`! To do so, let's create python programs that print the following faces and objects using only one `print` statement!

## Your Mission

In a file called `faces.py` use only one print statement per face to print the following!

### Face 0
```

```

### Face 1

### Face 2

### GameBoy
