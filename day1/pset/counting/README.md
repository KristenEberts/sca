# Counting

## Background

To solidify for strings and indexing, we're going to create a program that asks the user for a string as input and calculates the number of words and characters present in the string.

## Your Mission

Create a program called `count.py` that asks the user for a string. Then, use a for loop to go through each character of the string. For the characters, use a counter that you increment each time you go through a string character. In the for loop, check if you've encountered a space character, `' '` and if you have, then you can increase the numbers of words by 1.

### Example Runs

```

$ python count.py

Enter string: Hello world

Number of words in the string:

2

Number of characters in the string:

11

 

$ python count.py

Enter string: I love python

Number of words in the string:

3

Number of characters in the string:

13

```
